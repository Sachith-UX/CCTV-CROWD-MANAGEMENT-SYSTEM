# CCTV-CROWD-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The CCTV Crowd Monitoring System is a real-time video analytics solution developed for EngEx 2025 to monitor live crowd density across the Faculty premises. The system processes CCTV camera feeds, detects people using a YOLO-based model, and delivers accurate, up-to-date crowd counts to the central Heatmap backend for visualization.
